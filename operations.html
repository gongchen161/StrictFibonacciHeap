        <h2>Decrease Key - O(1) Worst Case</h2>
        <img src="decreaseKey.png" style="float:left; max-width:40%">
        <h3>To decrease the key of node x to v</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If x is the root - DONE</li>
          <li>If v is smaller than the root value, swap the two values</li>
          <li>Cut the subtree rooted at x and link it to the root</li>
          <li>Perform &le; 1 Loss Reduction</li>
          <li>Perform &le; 6 Active Root Reduction and &le; 4 Root Degree Reduction</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Trivially, all operations are <i>O(1)</i>, and we performe a constant amount of each step.</li>
            <li>Note, 3 Active Root Reduction + 2 Root Degree Reduction decreases both Root degree and Active Root numbers by 1. Since the violations could be broken by 2 at most(one from x and one from loss reduction), step 5 guarantees no violations afterward</li>
          </ul>

        <h3> Effects on Invariants</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><b>I1</b>: This is trivially true as linking to the root(passive) does not affect I1 at all and the transformations in step 4 and 5 do not cause this to be violated(as explained before)</li>

         <li> <b>I2</b>: Let y be the parent of x, if y and x are both active nodes, then the total loss will increase by 1 and may cause I3 to be violated by 1 (L = R + 2). However,by Lemma 3, we are guaranteed to be able to perform one loss reduction in step 4.</li>

         <li> <b>I3</b>: If both x and its original parent was active, the total number of active root may increase to R + 2. However, by Lemma 4, we are guaranteed to be able to perform the reductions in step 5.</li>

         <li> <b>I4</b>: The root degree increases by 1 after adding x. If this makes the root degree to be R + 4(violation), then by Lemma 5, we can perform the transformations in Step 5 to bring down the root degree (and active node number)</li>

          <li> <b>I5</b>: No non-root nodes get new nodes and no transformation will break this invariant.</li>

          <li>So, all 5 invariants are kept after decrease key</li>
 
      </ul>

        <h2>Merge - O(1) Worst Case</h2>
        <img src="merge.png" style="float:left; max-width:50%">
        <h3> To merge H1 and H2, and <i>w.l.o.g</i> assume size of H1 &le; Size of H2</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Make all nodes in H1 passive - This can be done in <i>O(1)</i> and will be shown in the next section</li>
          <li>Link H1 and H2 such that the root with smaller key becomes the new root</li>
          <li>Set the new Q to be Q1 + larger Root of H1 and H2 + Q2 (note Qi is the Q for Hi)</li>
          <li>Perform 0 or 1 Active Root Reduction and 0 or 1 Root Degree Reduction</li>
        </ol>

        <h4> Effects on Invariants</h4>
      
        <ul>

          <li><b>I1</b>: Trivially, no effects as no new active nodes are formed.</li>

         <li> <b>I2</b>: Trivially, no violation as the total loss will not increase (passive nodes no longer have loss) while R and N increased.</li>

         <li> <b>I3</b>: The number of active roots of the new heap is the number of active roots in the larger heap, since N (thus R) increases, no violations</li>

         <li> <b>I4</b>: The root degree increases by 1 after the linking. If this makes the root degree to be R + 4, then from Lemma 5, we will perform the transformations in step 4</li>

          <li> <b>I5</b>: During the linking, one root node becomes a passive non-root node. However, it had at most <i>R + 3</i> nodes before (by I4), and <i>R + 3 <= 2 log(2N - p) + 9</i> for any p. - no violations

          <p>
             All nodes in the smaller heap become passive, thus their degree constraints could go from + 10 to just +9. However, for the smaller heap, the new N is at least twice as big as before, and their position is unchanged in the new Q, thus the new constraint is actually increased by at least one - no violations
           </p>

           <p>
            All nodes in the larger heap remain their active/passive status and have their p pushed back by size Of Small Heap position, but N is also increased by the same size. So 2N - p actually increases and the constraints strengthened - no violations
           </p>
           </li>
          <li>So, all 5 invariants are kept after Merge</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Insert - O(1) Worst Case</h2>
        <h3> Assume we want to insert node x</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Create one heap with a passive node x</li>
          <li>Merge it with the main heap</li>
        </ol>

          <ul>
            <li>Since this is essentially just a Merge operation, no invariants are broken</li>

        <h2>DeleteMin - O(LogN) Worst Case</h2>
        <img src="deleteMin.png" style="float:left; max-width:40%">
        <ol>
          <li>Scan through the children of the root and find node x with the minimum value</li>
          <li>Make x passive</li>
          <li>Link all the other children of the root to x.</li>
          <li>Remove x from Q, delete the original root and make x the new root.</li>

          <li>Do this twice: move the first node, y, in Q to the back. If y has two passive children, link both to the root.</li>
          <li>Perform 0 or 1 Loss Reduction.</li>
          <li>Perform <i>O(LogN)</i> numbers of Active root reduction and Root Degree Reduction until none is possible.(Note we need O(LogN) times because every 2 Active root reduction + 3 Root Degree Reduction reduces root degree by 1, and the new root degree increases by at most <i>2logN + 12 + 4</i>(By I5 and &le; 4 new nodes from step 5), and Active Roots increse by at most R(by Lemma 2, x had at most R active children)</li>
        </ol>

         <ul>
            <li>This is <i>O(LogN)</i> since all operations are <i>O(1)</i>, but we need to perform the transformations O(LogN) times</li>
          </ul>

        <h4> Effects on Invariants</h4>

         <li><b>I1</b>: Trivially, no effects as no new active nodes are formed.</li>

         <li> <b>I2</b>: This could be violated by at most 1 because R and N are decreased while the total loss remains the same. However, by Lemma 3, we can perform one loss reduction in step 6 to bring it back within the range</li>

         <li> <b>I3</b>: As mentioned above, Active Roots are increased by at most R, so we will perform step 7 <i>O(logN)</i> times to bring it down.</li>

         <li> <b>I4</b>: As mentioned above, Root degree is increased by at most <i>2logN + 12 + 4</i>, so we will perform step 7 <i>O(logN)</i> times to bring it down.</li>

          <li> <b>I5</b>: Since N is decreased by 1, the constraints are strengthened. And this is why we perform step 5. By removing two nodes to the back, all the other nodes have p decreased by 2 or 3 (depends on if the node was before or after the new min node). Thus, <i>2n - p</i> does not increase and the constraints remain valid for these nodes. 
           </p>

           <p>
            For the two nodes that are moved back to the Q, their constraints reduced from, i.e. for Node 1, <i>2log(2oldN - 1) + 9</i> to <i>2log(2oldN - 2 - (oldN - 2)) + 9</i>. or decreased by 2. But if this is violating the rule, given it has &le; R active nodes, it must have two passive nodes for us to link to the root. Otherwise, no violation.
           </p>
           </li>
          <li>So, all 5 invariants are kept after Merge</li>
