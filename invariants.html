    <p> For convenience, we define R = 2logN + 6</p>
    <h2> I1: For an active node, the i-th rightmost active child has rank + loss >= i + 1</h2>

    <p> Lemma 1: If I1 is satisfied and the total loss is L, then the maximum rank of a nodes <= logN + SQRT(2L) + 2</p>
    <p> Proof</p>

    <p>Assume x is an active node with the maximum rank r >= k + 1 + logN, where k is the minimum integer such that k(k+1) / 2 >= L. We will use proof by contradiction that x will be a subtree with size N + 1.</p>

    <p>We let Tx be the subtree rooted in x. Given I1 is satisfied, i.e. the i-th rightmost active child of x has rank+loss >= i - 1, and the total loss is L. We can notice the minimum subtree that can satisfy this condition is the binomial trees Tb of size 2 ^ r with all nodes being active. Note that we need degree r since x need to have at least r children to have rank r, and we need a binomial tree so that the i-th rightmost active child has rank + loss(0) = i - 1.
    </p>

    <p>Now, we want to prunes the nodes in Tb so that it can have loss L and keep the size as small as possible since we want to prove the contradiction that x is at least size N + 1.
    </p>
    <p>
    To achieve the above goals, We need to prune the tree L times, and each time we want to cut the grandchildren of the root with the maximum degrees. We know for an binomial tree, there are j grandchildren of degree r - j - 1, so there are
    Sum 1 … k (j) = k(k+1)/2 grandchildren of degree >= r - k - 1.
     </p>
     <p>
    Since k(k+1)/2 >= L, We have pruned L times, and no grandchildren of degree < r - k -2 are pruned. That is, the (r-k)-th right-most child w of x has degree r-k-1 > log N and loss 0.
     </p>
     <p>
    Since it’s a binomial tree, size of Tw is N, and the size of Tx is at least N + 1.
    Thus, by contradiction, the original statement is true.
  </p>

    <h2> I2: The total number of active roots is at most R + 1</h2>

    <h2> I3: The total loss is at most R + 1</h2>

    <p>Lemma 2: All nodes have rank <= R</p>
    <p> Follow frmo lemma 1,
    <p> we have L <= R + 1, and we are given R = 2logN + 6</p>
    <p>Then, logN + SQRT(2(R+1)) + 2 =logN + SQRT(4logN + 14) + 2  <= R</p>
    <p> since (SQRT(4logN + 14))^2 <= (logN + 4)^2</p>
    <p>Thus, maximum rank <= R </p>
    </p>

    <h2> I4: deg(root) <= R + 3</h2>

    <h2> I5: deg(non-root) <= 2logN + 12</h2>
    <p> More specifically, let x be a non-root node, and let p be its position in Q. </p>
    <p> If x is a passive node or an active node with positive loss, and deg(x) <= 2logN(2N - p) + 9</p>
    <p> Otherwise, x is an active node with zero loss, and deg(x) <= 2logN(2N - p) + 10</p>
